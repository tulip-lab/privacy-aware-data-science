# Theoretical Foundations

In this module, a number of foundational concepts and methods related with `Differential Privacy` will be reviewed. Typically, `Probability and Statistics`, `Linear Algebra` and `Statistical Machine Learning` are the foundations for differential privacy. It is essential that you work through all information here in order to fully enjoy the later sessions of this unit.

Please be aware that we have several foundational units on this area

## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Lecture Slides Handouts

- [Lecture A: Probability Theory and Inequalities](https://github.com/tulip-lab/handouts/blob/main/Prob/FLIP09.pdf) :secret:

- [Lecture B: PAC Learning (I)](https://github.com/tulip-lab/handouts/blob/main/SML/FLIP11.pdf) :secret:
  
- [Lecture C: PAC Learning (II)](https://github.com/tulip-lab/handouts/blob/main/SML/FLIP12.pdf) :secret:
 

Not all above topics will be gone through in the lecture classes, and the unit chair will decide which one(s) to cover, based on the cohort's background and interests.
