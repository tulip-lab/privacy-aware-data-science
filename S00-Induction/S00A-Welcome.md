# Welcome to `Privacy-aware Data Science` :clap: 

Welcome to '*Privacy-aware Data Science*', the unit on '*Differential Privacy*'. As your instructor for this subject, I am excited to guide you through the nuances and complexities of this crucial field. Differential Privacy stands at the intersection of data science, mathematics, and ethics, offering robust solutions to the ever-present challenge of balancing data utility with individual privacy.

In this unit, we will delve into the theoretical foundations of differential privacy, explore its mathematical underpinnings, and understand its practical applications. You will learn about various mechanisms and algorithms that enable privacy-preserving data analysis, and we will also touch upon the ethical and legal aspects of data privacy.



We will discuss the details of the modalities of this unit very soon, but keep in mind that the unit is designed around [`Sessions`](../README.md#Sessions). We would like you to go through the sessions following the [`Recommended Session Schedule`](../README.md#session-plan) at the time of your ease.

I encourage you to engage actively in lectures, discussions, and hands-on sessions. Your perspectives and questions will enrich our collective learning experience. Whether you aim to apply these concepts in academia, industry, or policy-making, this unit will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complex landscape of data privacy.

Together, we will unravel the intricacies of differential privacy and prepare you to make meaningful contributions in this vital area. The [unit team](S00B-Team.md) is here to help you succeed, and I look forward to an enlightening semester of learning, exploration, and discovery.

Best wishes
