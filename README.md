## :bulb: Content

This *course* (aka *unit*) offers a focused study of `Differential Privacy`, tailored for data science and computer science professionals. It starts with an overview of data privacy concerns, leading into the core concepts of differential privacy, including ε-differential privacy, δ-approximations, and noise addition mechanisms like the Laplace and Exponential methods.

Key components include applying differential privacy to statistical analysis and machine learning, adapting conventional techniques to uphold privacy standards. Advanced topics cover federated learning and decentralized systems, emphasizing the field's evolving nature. Discussions on ethical and legal aspects of data privacy are included, preparing students to implement privacy-preserving solutions in various professional settings. The course aims to equip participants with essential skills in designing and managing privacy-conscious data analysis projects.


## :ledger: Sessions

Students will have access to a comprehensive range of subject materials, comprising slides handouts, assessment documents, and relevant readings. It is recommended that students commence their engagement with each session by thoroughly reviewing the pertinent slides handouts and readings to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the content.

Additionally, students are encouraged to supplement their knowledge by conducting independent research, utilizing online resources or referring to textbooks that cover relevant information related to the topics under study.


### :spiral_calendar: Session Plan

The proposed unit is structured to encompass a total of **100** class hours. This allocation includes **80** hours dedicated to instruction and teaching, complemented by **20** hours set aside for student presentations and discussions.

For optimal integration into university curricula, it is suggested that this unit be divided into two distinct segments (or two consecutive units). This approach is more aligned with typical academic scheduling and facilitates a more manageable and effective learning experience.

### :u6e80: Assessment

Every cohort might be assessed differently, depending on the specific requirements of your universities.

The assessment of the unit is mainly aimed at assessing the students' achievement of the unit learning outcomes (`ULOs`, a.k.a. objectives), and checking the students' mastery of those theorey and methods covered in the unit. 

#### :book: Assessment Plan

The detailed assessment specification and marking rubrics can be found at:
[S00D-Assessment](S00-Induction/S00D-Assessment.md). The relationship between each assessment task and the ULOs are shown as follows:

| :microscope: <br> Task  |   :man_teacher: <br> Category |  :dart: <br> [ULO1](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO1)  | :dart: <br> [ULO2](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO2) |  :dart: <br> [ULO3](S00-Induction/S00C-Logistics.md#ULO3)  |  Percentage | 
| :----: |  :---: | ------|-------| ----- |  ----- |  
| :one: | Presentation | 50%| 25%  |   25%  | **25%** |  
| :two: | Project |  | 30%  |   70%  |  **50%** |
| :two: | Report <br> Presentation | 20%| 40%  |  40%  |  **25%** |




#### :spiral_calendar: Submission Due Dates

- **SRM 2024** - The final assessment files submissions due date is :spiral_calendar: `Saturday, 18/05/2024` (tentative), group of **one** member only (**individual** work) for all tasks.

It is expected that you will submit each assessment component on time. You will not be allowed to start everything at the last moment, because we will provide you with feedback that you will be expected to use in future assessments.
